This is a batch script only executable by the command prompt in microsoft windows. 
It is meant to activate the entire microsoft office package.
click 1 as the first option.
click 2 as the second option, and then you're done and set to use your word, excel and powerpoint again without licensing issues.
That'll be all.... do have a great time using this script.
